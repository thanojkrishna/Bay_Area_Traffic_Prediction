**Contents:**
- `data_preprocessing.R` - Script for cleaning and preparing the dataset.
- `model_training.R` - Script for training and evaluating regression models.
- `visualization.R` - Script for generating key plots and visualizations.

---

## ðŸ“‚ notebooks/
Includes exploratory notebooks for in-depth data analysis and visual representation.

**Contents:**
- `EDA_traffic_flow.Rmd` - Exploratory Data Analysis report in R Markdown format.
